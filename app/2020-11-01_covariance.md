## Portfolio Return

In our last post, we covered how to calculate the expected return `E(r_(a))` of an asset. The Return of a Portfolio  `r_(p)` or a group of assets is the sum of the returns of each asset times the weight of each asset's holding.

```r_(p) = sum w_(s) * r_(s)```
```w_(s) = `the weight of the security in the portfolio```
```E(r_(s)) = ``` the expected return of that security 


## Portfolio Risk

In previous post we reviewed how we calculate the risk of an asset which is simply the standard deviation of the possible returns. 

## Modern Portfolio Theory
`Risk=sigma=sqrt(sum p(s)*[E(s)-r(s)]^(2))`
`"s = the asset or securiy given a certain state"`
`p(s) = `the probabiliy of the state
`E(s) = `the expected return of all states
`r(s) = `the extpecetd reurn of that specific state

Some Companies do better in down markets:(1) Precious Metals, (2) Certain Insruance Companies and Hedge Funds, and Forclosure Experts and Report Agencies

This is why you can't look at stocks individually. Rather, you have to look at how they move in relation to each other. The Risk of a portfolio depends on the correlation of the returns. For example, a portfolio made of primarily of tech companies will have a greater risk--a greater standard deviation of returns--because they all go up and down under similar market conditions. 

The risk of a two asset portfolio can then be written as:
`sigma_(p)^2 =  w_(d)^2 sigma_(d)^2 + w_(e)^2 sigma_(e)^2 + 2 w_(d) w_(e)*covariance(r_(d), r_(e))`

`sigma_(p)^2 =  w_(d)^2 sigma_(d)^2 + w_(e)^2  sigma_(e)^2 + 2*w_(d)*w_(e)*rho_(a),_(b)*sigma_(a)*sigma(b)*sigma_(b)`
