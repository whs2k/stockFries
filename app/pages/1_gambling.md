## Who Are you Betting Against?

The amateur investor (i.e. anyone who's not paid to do it) develops their portfolio of stocks in the same manner that they would bet at the poker table. In tournament poker you have metics like ICM and EV to guide you; however, you are in the end making a bet with imperfect information. In the investing world, however, the important thing to remeber is that on the other end of your limit  order on Robinhood or Schwab is someone else making the opposite bet as you; and it could be someone who is paid to do it who has a lot more tools than you do.

## Are You a Weak Thinker?

And then there is the matter of the [Efficient Market Hypthosis (EMH)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis)] which states that "It's All In The Price!" That is to say, that there are three ways to interpret the price of an asset or secturtiy:

- **The [strong form](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strongform.asp) of the EMH:** You can't beat the market because the price of an asset is the exact value of what it is worth. All information—both the information available to the public and any information not publicly known—is completely accounted for. "It's all in the price!"
- **The [semi-strong form](ttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/semistrongform.asp) of the EMH:** The market is [a random walk](https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Random_Walk_Down_Wall_Street/Avu090CNzb8C?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) and the price of an asset doesn't reflect its worth. Thus, you can beat the market by using [standard fundmanetal evaluation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp) metrics
- **The [semi-strong form](ttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/semistrongform.asp) of the EMH:** The market is [a random walk](https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Random_Walk_Down_Wall_Street/Avu090CNzb8C?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) and the price of an asset doesn't reflect its worth.

If you're here and/or picking individual stocks you're a Semi-Strong or Weak form of the EMH.
